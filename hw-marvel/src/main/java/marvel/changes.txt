Briefly list any changes you made to your graph class during hw-marvel,
and why you made those changes.

Answer: I modified my node class so that there was a constructor where there was only a nodeName as a parameter.
This was to help me reason through having a starting node with no incoming edge, and also makes sense to have
since some nodes will obviously not have any incoming edges. As a result, that particular constructor sets
the node weight to "" since it doesn't exist and it just empty. Additionally, I made it so graphContainsNode throws an
exception if it ever gets null as a node name (also added a junit test for it).
This is so I didn't need to write additional tests for making sure nodes were null when I was initializing
my pathfinding algorithm.

Minor Changes: Fixed ChrisGraph commenting error and removed TODOs since they were pointed out by TAs during grading
