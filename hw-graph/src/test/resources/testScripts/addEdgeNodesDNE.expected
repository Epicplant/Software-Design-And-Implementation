# Tests that adding an edge to nodes that don't exist won't break code

# Creates a new graph
created graph newGraph

# Adds a new node
added node n1 to newGraph

# Adds an edge between two nonexistant nodes
added edge 0 from n1 to n2 in newGraph

# Lists children of n1 which should be empty
the children of n1 in newGraph are:
