# Tests adding a singular edge between 2 nodes

# Creates a new graph
created graph newGraph

# Creates the edges starting node
added node n1 to newGraph

# Creates the edges end node
added node n2 to newGraph

# Creates an edge between the starting and end node with weight 0
added edge 0 from n1 to n2 in newGraph

# Lists all of the children of this node
the children of n1 in newGraph are: n2(0)
