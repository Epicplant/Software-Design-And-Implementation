# Tests that adding an edge that already exists doesn't change anything

# Creates a new graph
CreateGraph newGraph

# Adds a new node n1
AddNode newGraph n1

# Adds a new node n2
AddNode newGraph n2

# Adds an edge between n1 and n2 of weight 0
AddEdge newGraph n1 n2 0

# Adds a duplicate edge between n1 and n2 of weight 0
AddEdge newGraph n1 n2 0

# Lists children of n1 which should only have one copy of the edge
