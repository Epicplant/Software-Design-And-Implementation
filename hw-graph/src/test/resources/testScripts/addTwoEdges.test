# Tests adding two edges pointing back and forth between between 2 nodes

# Creates a new graph
CreateGraph newGraph

# Creates the edges' first node
AddNode newGraph n1

# Creates the edges' second node
AddNode newGraph n2

# Creates an edge from n1 to n2 with weight 2
AddEdge newGraph n1 n2 2

# Creates an edge from n2 to n1 with weight -2
AddEdge newGraph n2 n1 -2

# Lists all of the children of this node
