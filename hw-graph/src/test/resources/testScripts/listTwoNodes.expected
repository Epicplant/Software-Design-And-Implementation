# Tests that we correctly have a list of 2 node when ListNodes is called
# and the graph has exactly 2 nodes

# Creates our new graph
created graph newGraph

# Adds a new node "n1"
added node n1 to newGraph

# Adds a new node "n2"
added node n2 to newGraph

# Lists all of the nodes of this new graph
newGraph contains: n1 n2
