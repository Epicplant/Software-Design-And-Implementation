# Tests that adding an edge that already exists doesn't change anything

# Creates a new graph
created graph newGraph

# Adds a new node n1
added node n1 to newGraph

# Adds a new node n2
added node n2 to newGraph

# Adds an edge between n1 and n2 of weight 0
added edge 0 from n1 to n2 in newGraph

# Adds a duplicate edge between n1 and n2 of weight 0
added edge 0 from n1 to n2 in newGraph

# Lists children of n1 which should only have one copy of the edge
the children of n1 in newGraph are: n2(0)
