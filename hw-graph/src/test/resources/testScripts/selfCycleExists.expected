# Tests correct functionality with a self-loop

# Creates a new graph
created graph newGraph

# Creates the cycles first node
added node n1 to newGraph

# Creates a self-loop for n1 with weight 0
added edge 0 from n1 to n1 in newGraph

# Lists all the children of node n1
the children of n1 in newGraph are: n1(0)

# Lists all the nodes in the newGraph
newGraph contains: n1
