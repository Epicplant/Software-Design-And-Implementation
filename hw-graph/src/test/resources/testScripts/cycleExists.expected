# Tests correct functionality with a single loop

# Creates a new graph
created graph newGraph

# Creates the cycles first node
added node n1 to newGraph

# Creates the cycles second node
added node n2 to newGraph

# Creates an edge between the starting and end node with weight 0
added edge 0 from n1 to n2 in newGraph

# Creates an edge from the end node to the starting node with weight 0
added edge 0 from n2 to n1 in newGraph

# Lists all the children of node n1
the children of n1 in newGraph are: n2(0)

# Lists all the children of node n2
the children of n2 in newGraph are: n1(0)

# Lists all the nodes in the newGraph
newGraph contains: n1 n2
