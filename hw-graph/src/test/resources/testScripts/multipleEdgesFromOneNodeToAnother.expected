# Tests correct functionality for multiple edges going from one node to another

# Creates a new graph
created graph newGraph

# Creates the cycles first node
added node n1 to newGraph

# Creates the cycles second node
added node n2 to newGraph

# Creates an edge between the starting and end node with weight 0
added edge 0 from n1 to n2 in newGraph

# Creates another edge between the starting and end node with weight 0
added edge 0 from n1 to n2 in newGraph

# Creates another edge between the starting and end node with weight 2
added edge 2 from n1 to n2 in newGraph

# Lists all the children of node n1
the children of n1 in newGraph are: n2(0) n2(2)

# Lists all the nodes in the newGraph
newGraph contains: n1 n2

# Creates another edge between the starting and end node with weight 3
added edge 3 from n1 to n2 in newGraph

# Lists all the children of node n1
the children of n1 in newGraph are: n2(0) n2(2) n2(3)
