# Tests that we correctly have a list of 2 nodes+edges when ListChildren is called
# and the node has exactly 2 children

# Creates a new graph
created graph newGraph

# Creates the first node
added node n1 to newGraph

# Creates the first nodes child
added node n2 to newGraph

# Creates the first nodes second child
added node n3 to newGraph

# Creates first node
added edge 13 from n1 to n2 in newGraph

# Creates first node
added edge 27 from n1 to n3 in newGraph

# Lists all of the children of this node
the children of n1 in newGraph are: n2(13) n3(27)
