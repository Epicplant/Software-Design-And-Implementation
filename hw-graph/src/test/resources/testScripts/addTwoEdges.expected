# Tests adding two edges pointing back and forth between between 2 nodes

# Creates a new graph
created graph newGraph

# Creates the edges' first node
added node n1 to newGraph

# Creates the edges' second node
added node n2 to newGraph

# Creates an edge from n1 to n2 with weight 2
added edge 2 from n1 to n2 in newGraph

# Creates an edge from n2 to n1 with weight -2
added edge -2 from n2 to n1 in newGraph

# Lists all of the children of this node
the children of n1 in newGraph are: n2(2)

# Lists all of the children of this node
the children of n2 in newGraph are: n1(-2)
