# Tests that the output "no path found" is displayed when a path can't be attained between two nodes

# Creates a new graph
created graph newGraph

# Adds node A to the graph
added node A to newGraph

# Adds node B to the graph
added node B to newGraph

# Adds node C to the graph
added node C to newGraph

# Adds edge of weight 16 to the graph
added edge 16.000 from A to B in newGraph

# Finds the shortest path from node A to node C
path from A to C:
no path found

# Finds the shortest path from node C to node A
path from C to A:
no path found
