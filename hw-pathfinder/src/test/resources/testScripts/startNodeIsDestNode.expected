# Tests that if a node's destination is it's source that the cost is 0

# Creates a new graph
created graph newGraph

# Adds node 1 to the graph
added node 1 to newGraph

# Adds node 2 to the graph
added node 2 to newGraph

# Adds node 3 to the graph
added node 3 to newGraph

# Adds edge of weight 5.5 to the graph
added edge 5.500 from 1 to 2 in newGraph

# Adds edge of weight 2.5 to the graph
added edge 2.500 from 1 to 3 in newGraph

# Finds the shortest path from node 1 to node 1
