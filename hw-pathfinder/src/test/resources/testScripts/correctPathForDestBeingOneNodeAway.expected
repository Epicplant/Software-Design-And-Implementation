# Tests that a dest node that is only one node away from the source node gives the correct answer

# Creates a new graph
created graph newGraph

# Adds node A to the graph
added node A to newGraph

# Adds node B to the graph
added node B to newGraph

# Adds node C to the graph
added node C to newGraph

# Adds edge of weight 3 to the graph
added edge 3.000 from A to B in newGraph

# Adds edge of weight 3.888 to the graph
added edge 3.888 from A to C in newGraph

# Adds edge of weight 2.75 to the graph
added edge 2.750 from B to C in newGraph

# Finds the shortest path from node A to node B
path from A to B:
A to B with weight 3.000
total cost: 3.000

# Finds the shortest path from node A to node C
path from A to C:
A to C with weight 3.888
total cost: 3.888

# Finds the shortest path from node B to node C
path from B to C:
B to C with weight 2.750
total cost: 2.750
