# Tests that the weighted paths are rounded correctly when their sum is added up

# Creates a new graph
created graph newGraph

# Adds node A to the graph
added node A to newGraph

# Adds node B to the graph
added node B to newGraph

# Adds node C to the graph
added node C to newGraph

# Adds edge of weight 2.72341 to the graph
added edge 2.723 from A to B in newGraph

# Adds edge of weight 1.11114 to the graph
added edge 1.111 from B to C in newGraph

# Finds the shortest path from node A to node B
path from A to B:
A to B with weight 2.723
total cost: 2.723

# Finds the shortest path from node A to node C
path from A to C:
A to B with weight 2.723
B to C with weight 1.111
total cost: 3.835
