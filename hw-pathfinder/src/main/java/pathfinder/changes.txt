Briefly list any changes you made to your graph class during hw-pathfinder,
and why you made those changes.

Answer:

1.Changed the ChrisGraph.node field names (changed method and comment names to reflect this). This was
to make the fields make more sense now that ChrisGraph.node was generic since now nodes don't necessarily
store node names.

2. Made ChrisGraph.node a static class. This was so that the equals method would work properly and also
so that creating an individual node was a lot simpler (no longer new ChrisGraph(). new Node() but instead
new ChrisGraph.Node()).

3. ChrisGraph.node now has its edgeData set to null instead of "" whenever
only one parameter is placed into the constructor. This is to make it work with generics since not
all edgeData's will hold strings.

4. Changed graphContainsNode so that it throws an IllegalArgumentException if the parameter is null.
This is simply to make the graph method better since throwing an exception is better than requires due
to the exceptions giving a reason why the function doesn't work in the form of an error.

5. Changed the graph field in ChrisGraph so that it uses Sets to hold children of a node instead of lists.
This is to increase performance and make graph.get(node).contains() constant time.
